values I need: 
    tasks = [
        {}
    ] (state)
    completedTasks = int (derived)
    totalTasks = int (derived)
    addTaskText = string (state)

    user = {
        name, (string)
        awayTimezone, (dropdownList)
        city, (for weather API)
    }


* when tasks updates, as recomputation is perfomed, new value of completed & total is calculated
* hook to improve performance (useMemo, ...)
* i need to integrate with spotify API
* Ensure best practice, a11y, performance
